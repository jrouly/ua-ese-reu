  \item[Variable Type] Compound

  \item[Description] The \textbf{Degree of Interface Visual Richness}
  describes the extent to which an interface utilizes visual variables to
  increase visual discriminability of available tools. The component
  variables measured are a composite of several authors' research,
  including elements from visual language design. Each component variable
  is a boolean measure determining whether or not the described visual
  variable is used in the interface to distinguish available tools.

    distinguish between distinct tools or classes of tool. \cite{moody2009}

% {{{ subsection: Human Interface [incomplete]
\subsection{Human Interface}
\label{sec:humaninterface}

\textbf{Human Interface} components of an \ac{ide} include aspects of the
interface that describe how a human user interfaces with the \ac{ide},
either mechanically (\textit{eg.} through physical devices and media) or
mentally (\textit{eg.} the mental load required of the user to operate the
\ac{ide}).

%{{{ Subsubsection: Essential Efficiency
\subsubsection{Essential Efficiency}
\label{subsec:eefficiency}

\begin{AlignedDesc}
  \item[Abbreviation] \texttt{EEfficiency}

  \item[Variable Type] Continuous

  \item[Description] The \textbf{Essential Efficiency} of an \ac{ide}
  measures the level to which the system automates tasks for the user. It
  is calculated as the ratio of the number of steps in a concrete use case
  to the number of steps in the representative essential use case (see
  Appendix~\ref{app:euc}). \cite{constantine1996}
%
  \begin{align*}
    1 - \frac{\text{Number of steps in concrete use case}}
             {\text{Number of steps in essential use case}}
  \end{align*}
%
  Unlike the metrics for automation put forth in \cite{Wei1998}, this
  measure does not require user experience reports, and can be measured
  through simple use case analysis.

%{{{ Subsubsection: Interface Efficiency
\subsubsection{Interface Efficiency}
\label{subsec:iefficiency}

\begin{AlignedDesc}
  \item[Abbreviation] \texttt{IEfficiency}

  \item[Variable Type] Continuous

  \item[Description] The \textbf{Interface Efficiency} of an \ac{ide} is a
  concept related to the productivity of an interface. It measures the
  number of physical actions (including keystrokes, mouse clicks, and fine
  mouse movements) required of the operator to complete a task compared
  against the number of abstract steps in the representative essential use
  case:
%
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\text{Number of physical actions to complete use case}}
         {\text{Number of steps in essential use case}}
  \end{align*}
%
  This metric is different from the \textit{Essential Efficiency} proposed
  in \cite{constantine1996} because it studies physical user actions
  instead of concrete task steps.
