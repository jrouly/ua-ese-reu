% {{{ subsection: Human Interface
\subsection{Human Interface}
\label{sec:humaninterface}

\textbf{Human Interface} components of an \ac{ide} include aspects of the

either mechanically (\textit{eg.} through physical devices and media) or
mentally (\textit{eg.} the mental load required of the user to operate the
\ac{ide}).

%{{{ Subsubsection: Essential Efficiency
\subsubsection{Essential Efficiency}
\label{subsec:eefficiency}

\begin{AlignedDesc}
  \item[Abbreviation] \texttt{EEfficiency}

  \item[Variable Type] Continuous

  \item[Description] The \textbf{Essential Efficiency} of an \ac{ide}
  measures the level to which the system automates tasks for the user. It
  is calculated as the ratio of the number of steps in a concrete use case
  to the number of steps in the representative essential use case (see
  Appendix~\ref{app:euc}). \cite{constantine1996}
%
  \begin{align*}
    1 - \frac{\text{Number of steps in concrete use case}}
             {\text{Number of steps in essential use case}}
  \end{align*}
%
  Unlike the metrics for automation put forth in \cite{Wei1998}, this
  measure does not require user experience reports, and can be measured
  through simple use case analysis.

  \item[Range] $[0, 1]$

  \item[Critical Values]
  \begin{AlignedDesc}
    \item[$1$] There are no steps required to complete the concrete use
    case. Not feasible in practice.
    \item[$0$] Indicates a one-to-one relationship between the number of
    steps to complete a concrete use case and the number of steps in the
    essential use case.

%}}}

%{{{ Subsubsection: Interface Efficiency
\subsubsection{Interface Efficiency}
\label{subsec:iefficiency}

\begin{AlignedDesc}
  \item[Abbreviation] \texttt{IEfficiency}

  \item[Variable Type] Continuous

  \item[Description] The \textbf{Interface Efficiency} of an \ac{ide} is a
  concept related to the productivity of an interface. It measures the
  number of physical actions (including keystrokes, mouse clicks, and fine
  mouse movements) required of the operator to complete a task compared
  against the number of abstract steps in the representative essential use
  case:
%
  \begin{align*}
    1 - \frac{\text{Number of physical actions to complete use case}}
             {\text{Number of steps in essential use case}}
  \end{align*}
%
  This metric is different from the \textit{Essential Efficiency} proposed
  in \cite{constantine1996} because it studies physical user actions
  instead of concrete task steps. Also note that this variable can take
  negative values, indicating that the number of physical actions required
  to complete an essential use case exceeds the number of abstract steps in
  the use case.

  \item[Range] $(-\infty, 1)$

  \item[Critical Values]
  \begin{AlignedDesc}
    \item[$1$] There are no physical actions required. Complete automation,
    not feasible in practice.
    \item[$0$] Indicates a one-to-one relationship between the number of
    physical actions to complete a use case and the number of steps in the
    essential use case.
    \item[$<0$] Indicates a larger number of physical actions than steps in
    the essential use case. The lower the value, the less the degree of
    automation provided by the interface.

  process utilizes a single mouse click to indicate a selection and
    followed with subsequent mouse clicks elsewhere to define placement.
