\begin{abstract}
Software tools and working environments differ drastically from one domain to another. The software engineering domain is entertained by a diversity of rich integrated development environments (IDEs) that aim at simplifying the tasks and reducing the efforts of a programmer. Other domains are unfortunately not as cherished. In this paper, we survey twenty-five visual IDEs used in non-programming domains and evaluate how usable and fit they are for their domain. The goal of this research is to determine what features are needed in different domains and how they should be presented to the domain user.
