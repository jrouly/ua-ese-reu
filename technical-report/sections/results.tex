\paragraph{Alice3} Designed primarily as an educational programming
environment, Alice3 alienates skilled users by expecting a lower level of
skill in its domain. It makes up for this loss in accessibility, however,
with its wide, almost universal, support of common \ac{ide} features as
well as context-sensitive tooling. Alice3 provides a medium level of visual
richness in its interface chrome, but boasts one of the highest essential
efficiency values. This efficiency value is achieved through the ``MIT
Scratch'' style of visual syntax. However, despite greatly reducing
operator mental load, Alice3's clunky design only manages a near-neutral
interface efficiency. The introduction of optional keybindings is a
redeeming factor for Alice3 and, like most educational programming
\acp{ide}, Alice3 includes simple modular complexity management and a
visually appealing level of language visual richness.

\paragraph{AudioMulch} Although AudioMulch offers a wide array of tools and an in-depth interface ideal for professionals in the music industry, the overall complexity of the design greatly reduces the accessability for anyone else. It supports a large amount of popular \ac{ide} features, however, and offers equally high essential and interface efficiancy ratings.  This is visually assisted by a relation-highlighting feature which also provides AudioMulch with an implicit syntax enforcement, both of which greatly aid the user in model creation. Unfortunately, there is no effort made to manage the high amount of complexity within the \ac{ide} and virtually all of the canvas elements look exactly the same, ultimately awarding AudioMulch with a low language visual richness score.

\paragraph{Blender} Designed for a skilled target audience of experts in
the domain, it is no surprise that Blender supports most common \ac{ide}
features or provides context-sensitive tooling. Its high level of chrome
visual richness and the large number of perspectives available relative to
the average found in this study also contribute to a high quality
interface. However, its featurefulness leads directly to the second highest
observed value for visual clutter. Blender possess no particular efficiency
techniques, remaining around a perfect one-to-one relationship with the
measured essential use cases. Its heavy use of the keyboard reduces
accessibility to a wider audience, although the target skill level is
already a limiting factor. Finally, Blender provides modularization
complexity management through saving and duplication tools,along with one
of the most visually rich languages observed.

\paragraph{Grasshopper 3D} Though Grasshopper is able to provide the user with a relatively simple and easy to use interface, beginners would likely shy away from the complexity of its core functionality. Even so, it offers a high amount of popular \ac{ide} features and context sensitive tools, as well as the ability to search through its vast library of tools quickly and easily by name. Grasshopper also possesses very good efficiency techniques, maintaing both values at a more-than-decent level. In addition, the optional use of a keyboard is supported, offering functionality on another level to increase accessibility. Complexity management is not supported at all, however, and visual richness in both the language and tools are mediocre at best.
