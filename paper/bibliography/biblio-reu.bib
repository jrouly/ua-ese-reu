  Abstract                 = {In this paper we quantitatively model degree of automation (DofA) in supervisory control as a function of the number and nature of tasks to be performed by the operator and automation. This model uses a task weighting scheme in which weighting factors are obtained from task demand load, task mental load and using an experimental system. Based on controlled experiments using operators, analyses of the task effect on system performance, the prediction and assessment of task demand load, and the prediction of mental load were performed. Each experiment had a different DofA. The effect of a change in DofA on system performance and mental load was investigated. It was found that system performance became less sensitive to changes in DofA at higher levels of DofA. The experimental data showed that when the operator controlled a partly automated system, perceived mental load could be predicted from the task mental load for each task component, as calculated by analyzing a situation in which all tasks were manually controlled. Actual or potential applications of this research include a methodology to balance and optimize the automation of complex industrial systems.},

  Review                   = {three types of task automation
 + category 1: must be manual - ("tasks that must be allocated to the human operator")
 + category 2: can be automated or manual - ("tasks that can be performed by the operator or by automation")
 + category 3: must be automated - ("tasks that must be automated")

category 3 isn't terribly relevant since it doesn't affect mental load
note: creating automation tasks falls under category 1, since you need to manually start them

DofA should include number of tasks as well as the nature of the automation

since not all tasks are equal intensity / mental load, tasks should be weighted by intensity ("nature")


-------------------------
DofA = ratio of the sum of task weights of all automated tasks to the sum of the task weights of all tasks
ie.: DofA = ratio of weighted sum of automated tasks to weighted sum of all tasks

DofA = 1 - frac{\Sigma^N_{i=1} t_i w_i}{\Sigma^N_{i=1} w_i}

t_i = a piecewise task allocation indicator
 0 if Task i is automated
 1 if Task i is manual

N = total number of tasks

w_i = weight for Task i
 can be "how a task affects system performance" (system designer's intended effect of task on system performance) (top down)
 can be "how the task affects operator performance and mental load" (bottom up)
-------------------------

Note: if any task in {i...N} can be semi-automated, it should be broken into atomic parts

to better understand weighting, we introduce several takes on it:


TES = Task Effect on System performance
 ie. system error introduced by omitting a task
w^TES = weighting based on amount of system error introduced by omitting a task
DofA^TES is the metric based on w^TES


TDL = Task Demand Load
 ie. the imposed workload on an operator of a task
 includes task complexity, uncertainty, frequency, and performance requirements
w^TDL = weighting based on TDL
DofA^TDL is the metric based on w^TDL


TML = Task Mental Load
 ie. quantifies how much the task has affected the human operator
 includes task difficulty, task uncertainty, and arrival rate


w^c = weight for a manually controlled task
w^m = weight for monitoring the same task
w^mm = weight for monitoring the same task if it's manual
w^ma = weight for monitoring the same task if it's automated

note: w^m = t_i w_i^mm + (1-t_i)w_i^ma},
