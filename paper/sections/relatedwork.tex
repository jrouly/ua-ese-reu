A good starting point in the analysis of visual language \ac{ide}
suitability is an understanding of the visual languages themselves. The
interface supporting a language must ensure that the design choices made
within the language are mirrored and supported within the \ac{ide}.
\cite{hils1992} For example, languages with a high level of liveness
\cite{hils1992} would not be well suited to \acp{ide} developed with an
indirect trigger output generation style as any benefits from liveness are
lost. Additionally, domain-specific features of domain-customized languages
may introduce \ac{ide} requirements to maintain full support.
