\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The usability and suitability of an \acl{ide} can begin to be understood
through an analysis of its interface characteristics. Design decisions
involving the intended audience, the chrome or interface of the \ac{ide},
the style of human interaction, and features that affect level of language
support all impact overall usability and suitability. Even simple
convenience features like context sensitivity of searchable tools can
positively impact usability, while a lack of more integral characteristics
like visual richness can very negatively impact the quality of an \ac{ide}.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{subsec:future_work}

This study is not final or exhaustive. Additional \acp{ide} need to be
considered to grow the body of collected data. Research into new features,
revision of existing features, and extra analytical steps post data
collection would further the gained understanding of studied \acp{ide}.
This goal of this study has been to provide a technical foundation for the
systematic analysis and understanding of domain-specific visual \acp{ide}.
