The feature that exhibited the most agreement between \acp{ide} was the
multiplicity of available perspectives, with 13 \acp{ide} containing only
single available perspective. The next most agreed upon features are
interface visual richness and language visual richness which both indicate
nine \acp{ide} that support only four visual richness variables for either
interface or language. Note that \acp{ide} do not necessarily employ the
same number of visual richness variables for interface as well as supported
language.
