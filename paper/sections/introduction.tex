\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Software being a ubiquitous technology, it is nowadays being used in a wide spectrum of domains: music, teaching, arts, engineering.
The proliferation of visual \acfp{ide} has helped better assist these domain users who are unfamiliar with programming.
Common requirements to \acp{ide} in general often include~\cite{habermann1986}: uniformity and consistency across the different tools it provides, an interactive user interface for performing the different tasks, ability to inspect a well-defined state of the system being developed (\eg debugging), integrate control of versions of the system in an individual or collaborative environment, and ensure a manageable development process.

Many studies have surveyed \acp{ide}, but they were mostly focused on programming~\cite{}\es{}.
In this study, we focus on \acp{ide} used in non-programming domains where the underlying language is visual (\eg diagrams), as opposed to textual (\eg source code).

%A visual language \ac{ide} is a software tool that supports
%development within a specific visual language or set of visual languages.
%Often these \acp{ide} provide the operator with information about the
%syntax of the supported language(s) or otherwise provide features that
%integrate with any constraints of the visual language. Components and
%behaviors of the \ac{ide} interface can greatly affect the overall
%usability of an \ac{ide} as well as its suitability to its supported
%language. Consequently, it is important to utilize as many techniques as
%possible to ensure both overall interface usability and suitability to the
%target language.

%A good starting point in the analysis of visual language \ac{ide}
%suitability is an understanding of the visual languages themselves. The
%interface supporting a language must ensure that the design choices made
%within the language are mirrored and supported within the \ac{ide}.
%\cite{hils1992} For example, languages with a high level of liveness
%\cite{hils1992} would not be well suited to \acp{ide} developed with an
%indirect trigger output generation style as any benefits from liveness are
%lost. Additionally, domain-specific features of domain-customized languages
%may introduce \ac{ide} requirements to maintain full support.
